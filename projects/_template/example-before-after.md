## Notes
This transformation project demonstrates the power of strategic staging in a family home. The before photos show a property with good bones but lacking warmth and visual appeal. Through careful furniture selection, lighting improvements, and strategic accessorizing, we created inviting spaces that help buyers envision their own lives in the home. The staging addresses common buyer concerns while highlighting the home's best features and flow between rooms.
