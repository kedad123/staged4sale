## Notes
This Carlsbad home was staged as a REdesign+, incorporating pieces of the seller’s furniture and style into a cohesive, elevated presentation. Our team focused on enhancing natural light and coastal charm throughout, using neutral furnishings, layered textures, and strategic accents to unify the space. The backyard was transformed into a relaxing retreat with styled seating and poolside elements, highlighting the full indoor-outdoor lifestyle the home offers.
