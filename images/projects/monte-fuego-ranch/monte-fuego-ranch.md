## Notes  
Monte Fuego Ranch was staged to enhance the home's scale, natural light, and architectural flow while maintaining a warm, approachable feel. A transitional style was chosen to blend soft textures with clean silhouettes, complementing the home's structure and layout. Large-scale pieces were used to ground the open spaces without obstructing sightlines to exterior views. The neutral palette created a cohesive atmosphere, helping prospective buyers focus on the homeâ€™s features and potential. Accessories were placed sparingly to reduce visual clutter and support a calm, livable presentation. Select areas, such as the kitchen and bathrooms, were left minimally styled to highlight materials and invite buyer imagination.
