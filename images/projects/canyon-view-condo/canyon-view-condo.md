## Notes
This La Jolla condo was thoughtfully staged to showcase its architectural charm and maximize the natural light pouring through its canyon-facing windows. Soft coastal tones and clean, modern furnishings were used to create a relaxed yet elevated atmosphere. Key living areas were styled to enhance entertaining flow, while carefully curated decor helped define open spaces without overwhelming them. The vaulted bedroom and spa-like bath were finished with light layers and texture to evoke comfort, serenity, and a sense of retreat deserving of its coastal location.
