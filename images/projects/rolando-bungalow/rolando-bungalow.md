## Notes
This mid-century Rolando bungalow was staged to balance its original charm with a fresh, move-in-ready feel. The living room was styled with neutral tones and light furniture to enhance flow and showcase the refinished hardwood floors. In the kitchen, minimal accessories were used to let the dark stone backsplash pop against the bright cabinetry. Bedrooms were softened with layered bedding, textures, and simple art to create warmth and emotional appeal. The overall staging approach emphasized the homeâ€™s turnkey character and its potential for relaxed, comfortable living.
