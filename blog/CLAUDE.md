# Blog Style Guidelines for Staged4Sale

## Content Style Preferences

### Tone & Voice
- **Conversational and direct**: Use natural, engaging language that feels like talking to a friend
- **Data-driven but accessible**: Include real statistics but explain them in relatable terms
- **Confident expert positioning**: Speak from authority as ASPM™ certified professional
- **Honest and straightforward**: "Let's be honest...", "Here's the kicker...", "Let's face it..."

### Content Structure

#### Heroes/Headers
- **Blog index**: Keep hero minimal (25vh max) for faster content access
- **Individual posts**: NO heroes - use compact header with title, subtitle, meta info
- **Focus on content**: Get readers to the actual article quickly

#### Visual Integration
- **Images throughout content**: Use Unsplash images integrated into text sections
- **Alternating alignment**: Float images left/right to create visual rhythm
- **Quality sources**: High-resolution, professional staging/real estate images
- **Mobile responsive**: Images stack properly on small screens

#### Data Presentation
- **Stat boxes**: Highlight key numbers with visual impact
- **Source attribution**: Link to data sources (can use Unsplash for visual context)
- **Real numbers**: Use specific percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes

#### Testimonials
- **Integrate into content**: Place testimonials where they support specific points
- **Real client names**: "Sarah T., La Jolla", "David O., Realtor®"
- **Specific results**: Include actual outcomes (3 days, 4 offers, etc.)
- **Blockquote format**: Use styled quotes within content sections

#### Call-to-Actions
- **Clickable highlight boxes**: Make CTAs interactive with hover effects
- **Direct to contact**: Link to main site contact section (../../#contact)
- **Clear action text**: "Click here to get started →"

### Technical Implementation

#### SEO Requirements
- **Static HTML**: Hand-coded for maximum SEO benefit
- **Structured data**: JSON-LD markup for articles
- **Meta optimization**: Titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags
- **Clean URLs**: `/blog/post-slug/` format

#### File Management
- **posts.md**: YAML metadata for blog management
- **Manual sync**: Keep blog index and posts.md aligned manually
- **Static approach**: Prioritize SEO over dynamic generation

#### Navigation
- **Breadcrumbs**: Home › Blog › Post Title
- **Related posts**: Link to other relevant content
- **Author bio**: Include credentials and expertise

## Writing Style Examples

### Good Examples

### Data Integration
- Lead with the statistic, then explain the impact
- Use "real numbers" to make percentages tangible
- Include timeframes (7 days, 3 days, 2 weeks)

### Section Headers

- End with personality ("Do You Really Need Another Reason?")
